/**
 * There is a newer neosh, and here is what pressing this would do.
 *
 * Three things, and the third is the one this was missing. Saying *there is an update* is news you
 * did not ask for and cannot otherwise see, which is the definition of an alert — so it is raised
 * once, and never again for the same version. Saying *what updating means here* is not one sentence:
 * a binary Homebrew owns is updated by `brew`, one inside `node_modules` by npm, and only a
 * standalone one is neosh's to replace. The host works out which; this draws the answer.
 *
 * And then there is *you are not running what you installed*, which is the state almost everybody
 * ends up in and the one nothing said a word about. Most installs are managed, so most updates
 * happen in another terminal: `brew upgrade neosh` finishes, reports success, and the workspace
 * carries on executing the file it started with — for days, because a workspace here outlives the
 * terminals that look at it. Nothing had noticed, so `/update` said "you are on the newest" while
 * the newest sat on disk unused. The host now answers that with a `stat` rather than a registry,
 * this polls it, and the row says the one thing there is to do.
 *
 * `/update` is that one thing, end to end: check, download if it is ours to download, and **restart
 * when nothing is running**. It used to stop at "installed — restart to use it" and want a second
 * `/update`, which is a program telling you it has finished half a job and asking you to remember
 * the other half. The restart is still refused while a turn is in flight — a restart ends turns in
 * conversations this terminal cannot see — but that is a question with names in it, not a shrug.
 *
 * The row lives under the plan strip, because both are facts about the workspace rather than about
 * a conversation, and the plan is the thing you look at when you look down there. It is only ever
 * present when there is something to say — an update waiting, or a restart owed — so the column's
 * job stays your conversations.
