//! Finding out there is a newer neosh, and becoming it.
//!
//! Two halves that look like one feature and are not. *Is there something newer* is a question
//! about a registry. *May I replace this file* is a question about the machine, and it is the one
//! that decides everything: a binary under a Homebrew prefix belongs to Homebrew, and writing over
//! it leaves `brew` describing a version that is not on disk — `brew upgrade` then "succeeds" by
//! putting back the one we replaced. Same for a binary inside `node_modules`, same for one under
//! `~/.cargo/bin`. Only a binary nobody else is managing may be swapped, and everything else gets
//! told the command that would do it.
//!
//! The check is a plain HTTP GET against the releases API and is never done on the loop: it is
//! network, it can hang, and nothing on screen should wait for it. What it produces is kept, so
//! the answer to "is there an update" is instant and the *checking* is what happens in the
//! background.
//!
//! And there is a third question underneath both, which is the one people actually get stuck on:
//! *is the binary on disk the binary I am running*. It is not the same as either. Most installs
//! are managed, so most updates happen in another terminal — `brew upgrade neosh` finishes, says
//! it succeeded, and the workspace goes on executing the inode it started with. Nothing had
//! noticed and nothing said so, so the version you had just installed was not the version you were
//! using, for as long as that workspace lived. It is answered by a `stat` rather than by a
//! registry: the executable is stamped at startup and compared afterwards, which is true for a
//! `brew upgrade`, an `npm install -g`, a `cargo install --force`, a re-run of `install.sh` and
//! our own rename alike — and needs nothing from the network, so it is still true on a train.
