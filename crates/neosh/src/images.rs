//! Getting a picture out of the machine and into a message.
//!
//! Three ways in, because there are three ways people actually have an image to hand and only one
//! of them is a keystroke:
//!
//! * **the clipboard** ([`from_clipboard`]), which is where a screenshot is. This is the one that
//!   needs a key, because a terminal's own paste can only ever hand over *text* — bracketed paste
//!   is a text protocol, and no amount of pressing `⌘V` will make a PNG arrive down stdin. Every
//!   agent that does this shells out to the platform's clipboard tool for exactly that reason, and
//!   so does this.
//! * **a path that was pasted** ([`from_path`]), which is what dragging a file onto a terminal
//!   window does: the terminal pastes its path. Typing one has the same effect, which is the point
//!   — it is not a separate gesture to learn.
//! * **a plugin**, through the same [`from_path`], because the API is the product.
//!
//! The clipboard is the one with two halves. A program that copies a picture chooses what to put
//! on the clipboard, and copying one off a web page very often puts no bytes there at all — a URL,
//! or the `<img>` tag that named it, and the picture itself is still on somebody's server. So
//! [`from_clipboard`] answers with a [`Clipped`]: bytes it has already kept, or a reference for
//! [`from_url`] to go and fetch off the loop.
//!
//! # What is done to the bytes
//!
//! Read, sniffed, shrunk if it is enormous, and written once into the workspace's own directory.
//!
//! Sniffed rather than trusted: the media type has to be right or the provider rejects the turn,
//! and a `.png` that is really a JPEG is a thing that exists. The bytes say what they are in their
//! first few, and that is what is believed.
//!
//! Shrunk because a screenshot of a 4K display is eight megapixels and every provider we target
//! scales it down on arrival anyway — so the only thing full resolution buys is a slower request
//! and, on a metered connection, a worse one. [`MAX_EDGE`] is the long edge past which nothing is
//! gained. An image already inside it is written through *untouched*, which matters: re-encoding a
//! PNG that did not need it is a way to make a screenshot of text blurrier for nothing.
