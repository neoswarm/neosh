//! `neosh agent …` — the workspace, from a script.
//!
//! # Who this is for
//!
//! A person has `^T`, a sidebar and a transcript. A program has this: start a conversation in a
//! directory, watch what it does, read what it produced, steer it, stop it, throw it away. The
//! shapes are the same because they are the same calls — see [`crate::control`] — so a verb here
//! is a thin translation of one [`ApiCall`] and nothing else, and anything the panel can do that
//! this cannot is a verb somebody has not written yet rather than a capability that is missing.
//!
//! # Why every verb has `--json`
//!
//! The plain output is for a person reading a terminal and is allowed to change. `--json` is the
//! contract: it is the wire type, verbatim, one object per line for anything streaming. A caller
//! that parses the pretty output is a caller that breaks when a column is widened, and the way to
//! not have that argument is to give the machine its own answer from the first day.
//!
//! # Ten at once
//!
//! Nothing here is a session of its own — the workspace holds the conversations and this connects
//! to it — so twenty `neosh agent` processes are twenty sockets onto one workspace rather than
//! twenty copies of neosh. Fanning work out is a loop around `start`, and joining it back up is
//! `wait`.
